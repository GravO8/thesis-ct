# Towards Improving Ischemic Stroke Functional Outcome Prediction with Computed Tomography Brain Scans Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code used in my master thesis. The thesis itself can be be acessed [here](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meic-a/dissertacao/846778572213958).

The code for all the experiments mentioned throught the report can be found here (although not all experiments are in the master branch).
